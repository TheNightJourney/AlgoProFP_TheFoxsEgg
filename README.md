<h2> Contents of this Repository </h2>

<li>Driver.py - The Main File of the Repository. Run this to run the program.</li>
<li>Constants.py - Nothing. I'm not sure why it's still there.</li>
<li>maincode.py - Where the main functions lie. The functions like mainMenu() and others that drive it is in here.</li>
<li>reusablefunctions.py - These are strips of code that often repeat itself, so to save space and time, I place it here.</li>
<li>startfunctions.py - Quite a lot of work went to the introduction of the program, so important files are here too.</li>
<li>text_art.py - Just some snippets of art I saved.</li>
<li>resources/ascii_art.ans - An attempt to implement .ans files into the code.</li>
<li>resources/text_resources.txt - Where most of the ASCII strips are stored. Credit to the artist is also here.</li>
<li>data/finances.csv - The format template of the entries, and any user entries go here.</li>
<li>previous_data/filler.txt - A filler text file for GitHub uploading. Any saved .csv files are stored here.</li>
<li>AlgoProgFPDocumentation.pdf - Final Project Documentation.</li>
